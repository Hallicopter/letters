Hey A.R,

Last week I went to H&H Bagel in the upper east side. I live really close to it. Eating bagels on a saturday morning is one of the most nyc things I do. I even have a go to bagel order now. The everything bagel, with lox, capers and cream cheese â€“ untoasted.

This place is quite nice because I can see them making fresh bagels, and bringing it out as I spell out my order. I really love lox, smoked fish, with my bagel. I had never had lox before moving to nyc. Now I want to make my own lox. The origin of lox is in scandinavia. It found it's way to some east european jews, who found their way to nyc, where the lox bagel found its way to my mouth. I am a fan.

The lox bagel has become quite expensive, usually $15+. It's only on special treat days. But when you come here, I will take you to the place. Most of my knowledge about nyc comes from Seinfeld. There is a bit in Seinfeld where kramer used to work at an H&H bagel before they went on strike. So I was quite excited to check out H&H Bagels in person. I will probably be a regular now.

PS: N. V. prefers the avocado bagels, which are not bad, but don't hold the historic weight that lox holds. Lox is better.

See you soon,
A
